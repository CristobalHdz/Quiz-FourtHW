# Section 02: General Information
The assignment for this week is to make a JS fundamentals quiz from scratch. Which means doing all of the HTML, CSS & JS code from 0.

# Section 03: My experience
This has been the most challenging homework yet. From adapting everything to a decent CSS, to applying JS to the objects. I felt like the dificulty skyrocketed from the last homework. Being that said, I liked the challenge.

I have found that, for some reason, when applying a function to an event listener the arrow functions do not work so I had to make it the two separate rows way (One row with the listener and another with the function). 
I also had some problems with the bugs I encoutered like the timer, current question and score displaying when ending a game and starting a new one. I tried to reset them manually (score=0) but it doesnt work so I decided just to reload the page whenever the "Return to main page" button is hit. It is not the bets practice, but it is one that works perfectly in this homework.

By the time of writting this I still do not understand how to store the value of the score and name on the local storage. I feel like it would have been better to go on more detail about it. The examples from the classes were too simple and this example is way harder to apply our knowledge of it into the homework. When I finish the homework completly I will update the information.

UPDATE: After a lot of research I have managed to apply a hiscore system! You will have to override the last hiscore when you finish a game, but you cant enter a score without playing the game.
